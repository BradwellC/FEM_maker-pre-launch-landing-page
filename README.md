## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I am not always happy with the positioning with the images overflowing on a bigger screen than 1440px and how it will look - will need to remove it at a later date.

### Continued development

Getting better at CSS grid and creating website from the beginning and understanding how to create websites with less code.

### Useful resources
